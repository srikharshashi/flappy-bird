# Flappy Bird
It is a side scroller game which I made using Pygame module in Python and the objective is to score by crossing the pipes by jumping!     
Use <`SPACE`> to **Start/Restart** and <`W`or`SPACE`or`^`UpArrowKey> to **FLY!**  
That was a .exe file for Windows. Might launch support for MacOS and Linux Later  
Also looking forward to add implement NEAT ie,Neural Network  
Here are some screenshots:
